- duration in seconds
- year of release

## Technologies Used

## Features
Graphical User Interface should allow:
- adding a song
- displaying a list of all songs
- edit song data
- delete a song
- searching for a song based on the value of any feature
- displaying all songs with a release year above or below a certain threshold
- sorting songs on the basis of any feature (in the case of features described in words, the alphabetical order applies)
- saving song data to a file
- reading song data from a file
